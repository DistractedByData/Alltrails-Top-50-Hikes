# Hiking Trails Data Analysis
This data analysis project was undertaken as a personal endeavor to enhance my portfolio. Combining my passion for hiking with my skills in data analysis, I explored a dataset consisting of the top 50 hiking trails.

## Dataset Collection
To obtain the dataset, I manually collected data from AllTrails.com since they do not provide official datasets or an API. I carefully went through the top 50 hiking trails listed on the website and extracted specific pieces of information from each trail. The collected information was stored in a CSV file, which included the following columns: name, location, difficulty, length, elevation, reviews, rating, and route type.

## Analysis Insights
Analyzing this dataset provided valuable insights into the characteristics that contribute to a trail's high ranking on the top 50 list. For instance, I observed that the lowest rating among the trails was 4.6, and the lowest number of reviews was 6031. Therefore, it can be inferred that highly ranked trails typically require a significant number of reviews and a high rating.

Although the dataset was relatively small in size, it allowed me to practice and apply fundamental data analysis concepts. One notable finding was a positive correlation between a trail's length and elevation. Additionally, visually analyzing the data revealed that harder trails tend to have higher elevations compared to moderate trails of similar lengths.

## Future Exploration
I am enthusiastic about exploring more datasets similar to this one, where I can apply my personal interests in conjunction with data analysis techniques. By continuing to combine my hobbies and skills, I look forward to uncovering further insights and expanding my data analysis capabilities.
