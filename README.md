# Hiking Trails Data Analysis
This data analysis project was chosen as a personal project to add to my data science portfolio. In it, I combined my passion for hiking with my love for data analysis, by exploring a dataset consisting of the top 50 hiking trails ranked by Alltrails.com.

## Dataset Collection
To obtain the dataset, I manually collected data from AllTrails.com since they do not provide official datasets or an API. I carefully went through the top 50 hiking trails listed on the website and extracted specific pieces of information from each trail. The collected information was stored in a CSV file, which included the following columns: 
- name,
- location,
- difficulty,
- length,
- elevation,
- reviews,
- rating,
- and route type.

## Analysis Insights
Analyzing this dataset provided insights into the characteristics found among trails that are considered highly ranked. For instance, I observed that the lowest rating among the trails was 4.6, and the lowest number of reviews was 6031. These findings indicate that highly ranked trails typically require a substantial number of reviews and a high rating. However, it is worth considering that a trail's ranking may not solely depend on its quality. Factors such as the trail's popularity and location, especially if it is distant from major cities, can also impact its ranking. Therefore, a trail of exceptional quality may not rank high due to its relative obscurity.

## Future Exploration
I am enthusiastic about exploring more datasets similar to this one, where I can apply my personal interests in combination with data analysis.
